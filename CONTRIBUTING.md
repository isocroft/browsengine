## Issues

 - Improve code structure and refactor viewport detection code (It's rough on the edges)
 - Including unit testing (*Jasmine* would be nice, but you can choose what you're comfortable with)
 - Properly detecting retina screens on OLED displays
 - Detecting newer rendering engines like **Blink**
